# Intelligent System Resources

## About

A repository where I compile all my teaching materials for Intelligent Systems. Also some resources i found interesting throughout teaching the class. There will be articles, code, TL;DR, all will be put in this repository Issues. Inspired by [machine learning articles](https://github.com/khuyentran1401/machine-learning-articles)

This branch is for contribution guidelines only, if you're here and try to search for the code that I've created during the class go to this [master branch](https://github.com/arjasa1103/IntelligentSystemResources/tree/master)

### Why you should to contribute

Keeping tracks of all your data science and course material is hard, and with this repository I hope that problem can be solved. There are also multiple benefits:
* **Organized your materials** so that it is easy find your article for future reference
* **Quickly review** the key points of the articles and materials without reading the whole articles
* **Save the time** from looking for articles for your personal AI project
* **Help the community or your class** to learn easily
* **Ask questions or express your opinion** in the comment sections (~~because binusmaya's forum is useless~~)
* ~~_makes my job easier_~~

### How to contribute
To contribute a paper, please follow the format listed below:

* For articles that you would like to contribute, please create a new "Issue". **A template will be created** as you create a new issue. All you need is to fill in the section
* Use the name of the article as the title of the Issues.
* Use the following guidelines when submitting a new entry (Feel free to **skip any section** that is not relevant to what you are looking for):
  * **TL;DR** - A quick short sentence summary of the paper.
  * **Link to the article.**
  * **Author**
  * **Key Takeaways** - parts of the articles that you find useful.
  * **Useful Code Snippets** - useful codes that you want to save for later
  * **Useful Tools** - useful tools that you want to try out or integrate into your workflow
  * **Comments/Questions** - Your thoughts or questions on the articles. 
    * What do you like about this article? What you wish to learn more from?
    * What issues you have while trying to follow the codes or setup in the article?
    * What parts of the articles that you are puzzling about?

### Tips  
* The length of the TL;DR should be enough to **fit in a single tweet** (~140 characters). The "ideal" TL;DR should capture the essence of the problem being solved, the solution/approach the author has taken and the results. Please try your best to help communicate the essence of the article!
* Remember, regard this as your own folder. **Just write down the things that you think will be useful for yourself to look back!** If an article has many pieces of information, some of which you already know and too lazy to write down in the template. Just write down whatever you feel like writing. It is better to write something than give it up all the way
* If you are making a contribution for a specific article, please designate yourself within the **Assignees** of the issue. This will help us to identify who has provided content and accordingly give credit.
* Use the **Labels to tag the category** of the article accordingly. (Currently only contributors are only allowed to issue those tags, if you need to create a new label just comment on the issue on what label should be added)
* Use the comments section as a place to discuss, comment, ask questions or give feedback on the article.
